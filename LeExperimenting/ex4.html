        <h1> First Off:</h1>
        <p> I'm going to start off by basing everything that I can with the
        <br> same design as Chelo Creamery's website. No copyright infringement
        <br> intended. Thanks y'all! </p>
        
        <p> Now, I'm going to attempt to copy what I did in the previous 
        <br> experiment. </p>
