                <p style = "background-color:brown;">
                My favorite color is blue. This shade of <span style = "background-color:darkcyan;color:black;"> blue</span> is very nice, for instance.
                <br>
                Other colors such as <span style = "background-color: gold;color:black;"> gold</span> are very pretty.
                <br>
                I must apologize if that previous color looked yellow; I can assure you, it was gold.
                </p>

                Doing math: <br>
                You could ask me to solve exponential problems like 2 <sup> 3</sup> which is 8 by the way. <br>
                But asking me what e = mc <sup> 2</sup> is in reference to is not going to get you anywhere unfortunately; my apologies.
